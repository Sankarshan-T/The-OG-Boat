## 10/31/2025 - Researched on electronics required  

So I researched a bit, and while I design the boat in CAD, parallely I wanna make a hovercraft setup. So I found the best choice of components to be a thermocoal base, with a tire tube around it. For the electronics, I thought I could use 2 of these small motors used on drones (coreless motors) with a 1s ESC and 1S lipo battery and a flysky for the radio control (I have it). Here's a link to some ref videos
